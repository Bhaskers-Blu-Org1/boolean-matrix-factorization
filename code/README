To compile this code on linux type: make

To run this code on linux type: ./driver input_file_name.csv k tau perturbation_step perturbation_limit abcde
where
k is a positive integer corresponding to the rank
tau is a real
perturbation_step is a real
perturbation_limit is a real
a is 1 or 6 (1 and 6 correspond to algorithms 1 and 6, respectively)
b is 7, 8, or 0 (7 and 8 correspond to algorithm 7 and 8, respectively, and 0 means that no algorithm is run)
c is 8 or 0 (8 corresponds to algorithm 8 and 0 means that no algorithm is run)
d is 7 or 0 (7 corresponds to algorithm 7 and 0 means that no algorithm is run)
e is 0 or 1 (0 means no perturbation and 1 means perturbation)

For example:
./driver ../data/random_type1/xRandom_n30_m30_k5_f2_v1.csv 5 0.1 0.05 0.25 18801
